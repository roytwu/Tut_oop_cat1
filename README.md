### class_oop
This is a project about Class. Creating a class called "cat", which different cats can be named
And these cats can have different actions/mood defined as objects

constructor & destructor
1. Constructor is not necessary if in-class initialization is applied
2. There are two ways of defining constructor:
	A. In cat.h, under public key, type: Cat(); 
	   In cat.cpp, write a constructor function Cat::Cat(){...}
	B. In cat.h, under public key, type: Cat():...{}
	
	
### vector
The project is about how to use vector container in C++
- **vector_basic.cpp**: basic commands about vectors  
- **unique_paths.cpp**: a dynamic programming (DP) problem invovles using vectors


### inverse_a_string
Inverse a string with bitwise XOR `^` and `std::swap()` respectively. Also, demonstrate the difference between passing string by value and passing string by reference     


### matrix_library
Develope a demo library for matrix operation, obsolete project
