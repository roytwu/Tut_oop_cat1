# Learn C++
This is the repository about C++. The programs come with very verbose comments addressing concepts and syntax of C++. Most projects are developed under Linux environment, and a few are with Visual Studio.


ðŸ’¾ Projects
------------

## _cpp basic 
This is a dirctory including many basic concepts about C++. Projects under this direcotry are devepled under Visual Studio 2015 and CMake.
- ### function pointer
  beginner level example of function pointer
  
- ### template
  Sample code about function templates

- ### virtual  
  Sample code about `virtual void operator()()`
  
- ### cmake_example
  A good start to learn CMake
 
- ### pass_by_reference
  Straightforward example of passing strings and integers by reference 
   
- ### inverse_a_string
   Inverse a string with bitwise XOR `^` and `std::swap()` respectively. Also, demonstrate the difference between passing string by value and passing string by reference	  

## class_oop
This is a project about implementing class in C++. 

- ### 1-a. class_basic
  Creating a class called "cat", which different cats can be named
  And these cats can have different actions/mood defined as objects
  constructor & destructor
   
 - ### 1-b. inheritance
   Creat a super-class animal and its few childe classes
	
## vector
The project is about how to use the vector container in C++
- ### _basic
  Basic functions about vectors. Aslo have a example of using range-based for loop
- ### read_from_CSV
  Reading .csv files, this project includes vectors, file stream, boost libraries, and constructor overloading
- **unique_paths.cpp**: a dynamic programming (DP) problem invovles using vectors

##  data_structures 
- ### binary_tree
  Demonstrate how to build binary trees using class, and show 3 basic traversal methods in binary tree
  - pre-order: VLR  
  - in-order: LVR
  - post-order: LRV

- ### hash_table
  Create hash table using <vector> and demonstrate chaining with `<list>`

- ### matrix_library
  Develope a demo library for matrix operation, obsolete project   

	
## file_stream
Demonstreate how to use `<fstream>`: reading files, writing files, and parsing files  


## optional
Utilize the optional object from the Boost libaray

## operator_overloading
Illustrate basic concepts about operator overloading
